/**
 * Resolve the display status for an audiobook.
 *
 * The backend is the single source of truth for quality matching: the `/library`
 * list endpoint runs {@link AudiobookStatusEvaluator.ComputeStatus} server-side and
 * returns the result as `audiobook.status`. The frontend trusts that value and only
 * applies a client-side override for transient state the server's snapshot can't see —
 * an in-flight download for this audiobook.
 *
 * This deliberately no longer mirrors the backend QualityMatcher client-side; that
 * duplicated business logic and could disagree with the automatic-search cutoff.
